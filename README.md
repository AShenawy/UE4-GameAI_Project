# UE4: Game AI Project

This project implements AI Behaviour Tree and Blackboard included in Unreal Engine 4. This is made for the 'Artificial Intelligence for Games' course in Tallinn University.

### Prerequisites

 - UE4 editor version 4.23
 - Github Desktop (optional)

## Running the tests

There are passive and active tests included in the project. To run them, go to Window -> Developer Tools -> Session Frontend, then click on the 'Automation' tab and click 'Run Level Test'. The included tests will then run automatically with each test ending in 'success' or 'failed'. If the test fails, some information will be shown in the lower Automation Test Results message window.
With the current build, all tests were passed with success by the AI implementation.
